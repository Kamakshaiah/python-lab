The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted religion and faith in different ways. Numerous restrictions have been implemented worldwide. Believers are in conflict with authorities’ warnings that gatherings must be limited to combat the spread of the virus. Religion has always played a role of the balm for the soul, and the regular religious participation is associated with better emotional health outcomes. In our study, we examined whether the exposure to COVID-19 enhances the faith. The instrument used was a survey verifying the power of spirituality in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
As the number of coronavirus confirmed cases approaches 845,000 in 202 countries and territories around the world (more than 41,000 deaths has been reported so far)Footnote 1 and since scientists and politicians struggle to agree a response to the economic, social and health crisis due to the pandemic, many people are turning toward faith. The inspiration for this publication was strong words of the Polish Deputy Prime Minister who said that “Churches are like hospitals for the soul”. But is what is good for the soul always good for the body? Since the disease is a novelty to us, at first no protocols had really existed to fight it. It had not been subject to strict control, and referring to the data, Italy has become a hot spot of Europe with the largest number of people infected with Covid-19 after the virus’s expansion in China. The coronavirus outbreak in Europe has become a game changer for surveillance.
Over 98% of Poles are Christians, but only about 82% consider themselves to be actively practicing their religion. The rest reveals attending church services for a sense of duty or willingness to pass the tradition to their children. Modern European society is delineated by indifference to religious institutions or ideology and the concept of God functions as a force majeure, fate or destiny. However, in the face of illness and suffering, a significant change of attitude is observed, as evidenced by numerous testimonies of Italian doctors. Religious creeds and beliefs not only allow us to understand but they also influence the meaning of many events occurring in everyone’s life. With this approach, faith or broadly understood spirituality is a force that helps to overcome mental crisis as well as facilitate adaptation to the disease or the restrictions resulting from it.
In light of pandemic of COVID-19, most people are much more open to faith as well as prayer. The virus is going to be spreading rapidly and causing enormous crisis in all societies. In the current pandemic, engagement with religious practices gives us control over the situation, helps to make it understandable and what is most important gives us hope.
Taking the above into consideration, our study was aimed to verify the power of faith in the face of COVID-19 threat.
The study group consisted of 324 respondents, and the survey was conducted among Polish society from March 13 to 16, 2020. The dates are of significance as it was the period when the Covid-19 fear has started to spread nationwide. The first case of infection with Covid-19 in Poland was reported on March 4, 2020. Since March 14, 2020, an epidemic emergency has been in force, and on March 15, 2020 a sanitary cordon was implemented around the Polish borders, significantly limiting border traffic. The survey was distributed among the general population via Google docs using popular mobile messengers and other social media channels.
The tool measured ten dimensions: sex, age, education, place of residence, faith, the essence of faith in life, the practice of prayer, the importance of faith/spirituality in connection with coronavirus danger, strengthening of the faith/spirituality in connection with the increasing coronavirus risk, the belief that faith/spirituality will increase the sense of security in the times of the pandemic.
Data collection was carried out online and the designed tool used different scales, depending on questions. In order to gather socio-demographic data, we created our own part of the survey. For assessing the essence and the practice of prayer, we used 5-point Likert scale. For assessing the importance of faith/spirituality and its strengthening and influence, we used a yes/no questionnaire.
Comparisons between variables in the described subgroups of men and women were evaluated using Student’s t test.
All procedures performed in the study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Institutional Research Committee (Bioethical Committee of Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun). The survey was anonymous, conducted electronically, and did not require providing any personal data.
The study group consisted of 327 respondents (three respondents were excluded due to incomplete responses), yielding the final study population of 324 (N = 324). The study population is presented in Table 1. Of the 327 subjects surveyed, 50.6% were men and 49.4% were women. The largest group of respondents (54%) is situated in the age range of 21–35 years of age. The majority of the study group completed a secondary level of education (37.3%) or have college or university degree (52.2%). Almost half of the respondents declared living in cities of over 250,000 inhabitants (42.9%).
With regards to the faith, among the vast majority of participants declared to be Catholics (91.7%, N = 297; 52.5% between the ages of 21 and 35; 72.4% < 50), within this group there were 51.5% of men (N = 153) and 48.5% of women (N = 144). Among those Catholic respondents who stated that faith plays a very important role in their lives, 57.9% were men and 42.1% were women. The instrument used in this part of the survey was the 5-point Likert scale where 1 was very important, 2 important, 3 rather important, 4 less important, 5 not important. Over half of the Catholic respondents disclosed that faith played a very important role in their lives (55.2%, N = 297; level 1 Likert scale); the largest group consisted of young people in the age range of 21-35 (62.2%). In comparison with the total number of participants (N = 324), level 1 Likert scale was declared by 51.5% (N = 167) and level 2 L.s. by 24,1% (N = 78).
We were also interested in examining the act of prayer practicing by the Catholic respondents. The obtained results revealed that 34,3% of the participants practices their religion very often (N = 297; 31.8% in N = 324; level 1 L.s.). Within this group, 44.1% were women and 55.8% were men. Almost 60% of the aforementioned group consisted of people between the ages of 21–35 (59.8%; 69.6% < 50).
For assessing the faith/spirituality importance and the strengthening and protective influence of faith/spirituality, we designed a yes/no questionnaire. The three queries of our interest were referenced to 1) the importance of faith/spirituality in connection with coronavirus danger, 2) strengthening of the faith/spirituality in connection with the increasing coronavirus risk and 3) the belief that faith/spirituality will increase the sense of security in the times of the pandemic. 67.6% of the respondents declared that faith/spirituality was important to them in the face of Covid-19 pandemic (N = 219); 72% of Catholics gave a positive answer to this query, and within this group there were 42.5% of women and 57.5% of men; the largest group consisted of young people in the age range of 21–35 (57%), respondents in the age range of 36–50: 12.14%, < 50: 69.16%, > 50: 30.84%. However, for the majority of the total number of the respondents, the religious involvement did not strengthen due to the risk of the infection (75.3%, N = 244; within the Catholic respondents 25,9% stated strengthening their faith). The outcomes obtained in the last section of the survey with regards to the belief in the protective power of faith and the increased sense of security over 40% responses revealed trust in such capability (40.7%, N = 132), compared to the Catholic respondents of whom 43.8% (N = 297) declared the belief in the protective power of faith (within this group 43.1% were women and 56.9% were men; 76% < 50).
In the aspect of education, the outcomes are worth further discussion. A crucial role of faith in life was declared by 72.05% (N = 297) of the Catholic respondents, including 45.79% of respondents who have college or university degree and 42.06% of respondents who completed a secondary level of education (87.85% in total). The majority of respondents did not declare that their faith had strengthened in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic threat (74.07% of “no” responses); within this group, 89.55% respondents completed a secondary level of education or have college or university degree. The last question of the survey investigated the increase of the respondents’ sense of security and their belief in the protective power of faith in the times of the pandemic. As many as 86.92% of respondents who completed a secondary level of education or have college or university degree stated a “yes” response.
Spirituality in the context of healthcare is a relatively new area yet becoming increasingly important. In the recent years, research has shown that religious beliefs and practices are associated with various health aspects, such as ability to cope with the disease, recovery after hospitalization and a positive attitude in a difficult situation, including health (Albers et al. 2010; Puchalski et al. 2009; Phelps et al. 2009). Therefore, the importance of spirituality in clinical practice has been highlited (Best et al. 2015). In general terms, spirituality is most often defined as the search for a “higher sense” with regards to religion or belief in God (Mishra et al. 2017). Most societies or people referred to as “Westerners” have successfully learned to resort to suffering and moral dilemmas. The convenience and comfort of life most often causes a lack of reflection as well as pushing away disturbing thoughts. The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has caused distinct human responses and reactions, has strengthened us and made us aware of the fragility of our human existence. We have been taught a lesson in humility, but we are also accompanied by feelings of powerlessness and fear.
In our survey in the face of the growing coronavirus pandemic, we were interested in the role of faith/spirituality in the general population of Poles, especially since the situation in Poland was not very serious at the time of our research study.
The analysis of the conducted survey, with 324 participants, showed that mainly young people, both women and men, dominated. In the group of young people between the ages of 21 and 35, the essence of faith was of a great importance and was declared to be accompanied by the frequent practice of prayer. In Poland, there has been a discussion of a growing crisis of faith in the younger generation and their lack of attachment to church traditions. This survey group makes an extremely interesting case for further analysis because it has never experienced such a social disaster before. Our research proves that women more often declare strengthening their faith/spirituality in the face of the coronavirus hazard. Also worldwide research indicates that women participate in religious life more often, pray more or feel a greater presence of God in everyday life (Forlenza and Vallada 2018; Peteet et al. 2019; Li et al. 2016). To a large extent, this is probably due to psychological differences between men and women, also in the metaphysical sphere. At the same time, within this study group, young women believe that faith will protect them from the coronavirus infection (64%). Perhaps this is related to the image of God as a good and merciful father who will be able to save us from all evil and suffering. In general, the development of faith is also observed in the group of the elderly, which may be caused by the awareness of the inevitability of death (Harrington 2016; Hodge et al. 2011). The coronavirus pandemic, however, also caused fear of death in younger people, which is compounded by the world media reports about the deaths of young people who are not burdened with additional diseases. Such anxiety more often accompanies women, which is also reported and proved in our study. Women appreciate family values very much, care for the needs of their loved ones and often entrust their fate to divine protection (Simon 1995). Emphasized should also be the fact that completing the survey resembles a declaration, and men are less willing to admit their beliefs or religious values. Hence, in a sense, there may be differences between sexes, also visible in the presented research study.
To conclude, when being exposed to a threat we use various strategies of survival, faith being one of them, which allows us to keep hope as well as feel sense of security. The current worldwide situation can bring people together, also through joint prayer.
Modern societies, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, focused mainly on the body and well-being, largely excluding spirituality and thus narrowing human desires only to the physical sphere. A man of body and emotions dominated over a man of spirit. Our research conducted as part of the survey indicates that people experiencing fear, suffering or illness often experience a “spiritual renewal.” Perhaps a new “generation of coronavirus” is being shaped, in which the development of spirituality will create the mature attitude based on truth and freedom.

Evidence shows that religiosity and spirituality (R/S) are highly used in critical moments of life and that these beliefs are associated with clinical outcomes. However, further studies are needed to assess these beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
To evaluate the use of R/S during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and to investigate the association between R/S and the mental health consequences of social isolation.
Cross-sectional study conducted in May 2020. Online surveys were carried out assessing sociodemographics, R/S measures, and social isolation characteristics and mental health consequences (hopefulness, fear, worrying and sadness). Adjusted regression models were used.
A total of 485 participants were included from all regions of Brazil. There was a high use of religious and spiritual beliefs during the pandemic and this use was associated with better mental health outcomes. Lower levels of worrying were associated with greater private religious activities (OR = 0.466, CI 95%: 0.307–0.706), religious attendance (OR = 0.587, CI 95%: 0.395–0.871), spiritual growth (OR = 0.667, CI 95%: 0.448–0.993) and with an increase in religious activities (OR = 0.660, CI 95%: 0.442–0.986); lower levels of fear were associated with greater private religious activities (OR = 0.632, CI 95%: 0.422–0.949) and spiritual growth (OR = 0.588, CI 95%: 0.392–0.882) and, lower levels of sadness (OR = 0.646, CI 95%: 0.418–0.997) were associated with spiritual growth. Finally, hope was associated with all R/S variables in different degrees (ranging from OR = 1.706 to 3.615).
R/S seem to have an important role on the relief of suffering, having an influence on health outcomes and minimizing the consequences of social isolation. These results highlight the importance of public health measures that ensure the continuity of R/S activities during the pandemic and the training of healthcare professionals to address these issues.
Since the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international interest (Lake, 2020). In this context, the experience reported in previous humanity crises have shown that individuals exposed to these situations can usually develop a series of mental health problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, generalized anxiety, panic, phobias and substance abuse (Acierno et al., 2007; Mason et al., 2010).
The COVID-19 pandemic is having and will have important consequences, not only to the physical health, but also to the mental health of the population (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020). A recent systematic review (Rogers et al., 2020) have identified that these psychiatric consequences can have implications for both the short and long terms and will probably increase the prevalence of depression, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia and post-traumatic stress.
Currently, social distancing is considered an effective measure to reduce the high infectivity of the disease, so most countries of the world have adopted this procedure in order to minimize contagion and consequences for public health systems (Usher et al., 2020). If on the one hand, social distancing has reduced the pressure on hospital beds; on the other hand, it has caused other consequences such as unemployment, lack of medical appointments and impairment in mental health (Rogers et al., 2020; VanderWeele, 2020b).
The exposure to the pandemic stress and the social isolation seem to increase mental health problems, creating challenges for public health managers and mental healthcare professionals (Banerjee, 2020). In this situational framework, individuals become more vulnerable to negative feelings (e.g. anxiety and fear) and irrational ideas, which may be intensified by news reports on the increase in cases and deaths (Lima et al., 2020).
There are several strategies to reduce these negative consequences of social isolation, such as using social medias, contacts with family and friends through digital technologies, online classes, virtual workplaces and the use of religious and spiritual beliefs (Galea et al., 2020; Koenig, 2020). In fact, religiosity and spirituality (R/S) have been used to handle crisis situations and stress for a long time (Ebadi et al., 2009; Schuster et al., 2001; Thune-Boyle et al., 2006). Studies have already reported the effects of R/S in physical and mental health, promoting higher levels of life satisfaction, well-being, sense of purpose, meaning of life, hope, optimism and lower rates of anxiety, depression and substance abuse (Koenig, 2012).
The previous evidence suggests that R/S could be an important tool for the population to deal with the new pandemic reality. However, despite the fact that several authors have already proposed R/S interventions during the pandemic (Del Castillo et al., 2020; Ferrell et al., 2020), few studies (Pirutinsky et al., 2020; Weinberger-Litman et al., 2020) have investigated how these beliefs are used and whether they can minimize the social isolation consequences during this pandemic.
In an attempt to bridge this gap, the present study aims to evaluate the use of religious and spiritual beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and to investigate the association between R/S and the mental health consequences of the social isolation (i.e. hopefulness, fear, worrying and sadness).
This was an observational cross-sectional quantitative study carried out in the month of May 2020 (the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil). This study was submitted and approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the São Camilo University Center (São Paulo, Brazil) under approval number 4.047.769, CAAE 31154920.0.0000.0062 and all participants consent to participate signing an online form.
In order to be included participants should: have at least 18 years old, live in Brazil (all regions were accepted), be experiencing the pandemic of COVID-19, be able to read and write in Portuguese and be in social isolation for at least 10 days (this cutoff was used to guarantee that participants were facing the consequences of social isolation).
Participants were invited online by the researchers using social medias and emails. This was carried out using a ‘snowball technique’ (i.e. nonprobability sampling where study subjects recruit future subjects from among their contacts) in a sense that the researchers used their social medias and emails and asked their own contacts to disseminate the study to the largest number of individuals. The questionnaire was available for answers during a period of four complete weekdays.
The questionnaire took approximately 10 minutes to be filled in and it was delivered online using Google Forms®. The first page of the form was an online consent and the participant had the opportunity to agree or not with the terms of the study. The following questions were used:
a) Sociodemographic data: age, gender, profession, marital status and education.
b) Religious and Spiritual Beliefs:
- Religious affiliation: respondent could choose different religious affiliations (e.g. Catholics, Spiritists, Evangelicals) or could report not having a religion. Those not having a religion were separated in spiritual but not religious or non-believers (e.g. atheists).
- Religious attendance: the question ‘How often do you attend church or other religious meetings?’ based on the first item of the Duke Religion Index validated into Portuguese was used (Lucchetti, Lucchetti, Peres, Leão, et al., 2012). Answers were adapted from the original version using a likert of eight items ranging from ‘Never’ to ‘Everyday’.
- Religious private activities: the question ‘How often do you spend time in private religious activities, such as prayer, meditation or Bible study?’ based on the first item of the Duke Religion Index validated into Portuguese was used (Lucchetti, Lucchetti, Peres, Leão, et al., 2012). Answers were adapted in a likert of eight items ranging from ‘Never’ to ‘Everyday’.
- Importance of Religion: a self-reported religiousness question from the Duke NIMH Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study in 1994 and adapted to the Brazilian context was used (Lucchetti, Lucchetti, Peres, Moreira-Almeida, & Koenig, 2012), asking about the importance of religion to life. Five point Likert answers ranged from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Very important’
- Religion/Spirituality helping in the social isolation: a question asking how R/S was helping participants in coping with the social isolation was created by authors with five possible answers: ‘not helping’ to ‘Helping a lot’.
- Spiritual growth: participants were asked whether the pandemic was responsible to promote a spiritual growth. This question was developed by researchers and was contextualized to the pandemic moment. Possible answers range in 5 points: ‘Not growing at all’ to ‘Growing a lot’.
- Religious activities during social isolation: another question created by researchers aiming to understand if the religious practices were impacted by the social isolation. Three possible answers were allowed: ‘Improved’, ‘No change’ and ‘Worsened’.
c) Social isolation characteristics: questions concerning the social isolation were developed, including the Region of social isolation, the number of days in social isolation, if the participant was able to maintain his/her job or study at home, if the participant was having an income during social isolation and how many persons the participant was isolated with.
d) Social isolation consequences: after a discussion with researchers and based on the literature, some consequences of the social isolation were raised in order to create the questionnaire. Thus, fear, worrying, sadness and hopefulness were included as important markers of social isolation. Questions were developed as follows: ‘How afraid are you with the pandemic?’, ‘How worried are you with the pandemic?’, ‘How sad are you with the pandemic?’ and ‘How hopeful are you with the pandemic?’. The possible answers for each question were divided into four categories: ‘Very’, ‘Little’, ‘Not al all’ and ‘Indifferent’.
Descriptive analyses were carried for the sociodemographic data, spiritual/religious beliefs, social isolation characteristics and its mental health consequences using mean and standard deviation for continuous measures and absolute numbers and percentages for ordinal or categorical measures. After this descriptive analysis, dichotomous variables were created for the Likert items.
In the inferential analyses, logistic regression models were conducted using dichotomous religious and spiritual measures (e.g. Religious attendance: 1 = Once a week or more and 0 = Less than once a week) as independent variables and the mental health consequences of social isolation (e.g. How afraid are you with the pandemic? 1 = Very afraid and 0 = Little/Not al all/Indifferent) as dependent variables. Models were adjusted for sociodemographics (Model 1: age, gender, profession, Marital Status, Education) and for the social isolation characteristics (Model 2: Region, number of days in social isolation, able to maintain your job or study at home, still having an income during social isolation, isolated with how many persons). Odds ratio were reported with 95% Confidence intervals.
Analyses were carried out in SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc.) and a p-value ⩽ 0.05 was considered significant.
From a total of 544 responses in the Google Forms, 485 participants were included in the final analysis. Reasons for exclusion were: participant didn’t agree with the consent term (n = 1), missing information (n = 2), less than 10 days of social isolation (n = 30) and duplicate data (n = 26).
The sample was mostly composed by females (79.2%), students (54.2%), with complete or incomplete university level (86.6%), single (70.3%), with mean age of 31.8 (SD 13.7) years and from all regions of Brazil. Concerning the religious and spiritual characteristics, 75.7% had a religious affiliation (42.8% of them Catholics), 17.5% did not have an affiliation but considered themselves ‘spiritual’ and 6.6% did not have a religious affiliation (Atheists and non believers). At least 44.1% attended to religious services once a week or more, 62.3% carried out religious private activities more than once a week and 76.7% considered religion important to their lives. Most participants (73.4%) reported that R/S was helping them to cope with the social isolation, 57.3% have experienced a spiritual growth and 33.8% believed that the social isolation has improved their religious activities (Table 1).

Table 1. Sociodemographic and spiritual/religious characteristics of the sample.
Table 2 presents the characteristics and consequences of social isolation. The number of days in social isolation was 41.9 (SD 8.4) and the number of persons isolated together in the same household was 2.5 (SD 1.3). Most participants were able to maintain their routine of job or study (84.1%) and their income (50.5%). As a consequence of social isolation, 31.5% of participants were ‘very afraid’, 65.2% were ‘very worried’ and 24.7% were ‘very sad’ with the pandemic. Despite these numbers, 60.4% reported being ‘very hopeful’ with this situation.

The logistic regression models for the association between religious variables and mental health outcomes are shown in Table 3. After adjustment: (a) participating in private religious activities was associated with lower levels of fear (OR = 0.632, CI 95%: 0.422–0.949, p < 0.05) and lower levels of worrying (OR = 0.466, CI 95%: 0.307–0.706, p < 0.001), (b) Higher levels of spiritual growth was associated with lower levels of fear (OR = 0.588, CI 95%: 0.392–0.882, p < 0.05), lower levels of worrying (OR = 0.667, CI 95%: 0.448–0.993, p < 0.05) and lower levels of sadness (OR = 0.646, CI 95%: 0.418–0.997, p < 0.01), (c) higher levels of religious attendance was associated with lower levels of worrying (OR = 0.587, CI95%: 0.395–0.871, p < 0.01), (d) improving religious activities was associated with lower levels of worrying (OR = 0.660, CI 95%: 0.442–0.986) and (e) all religious variables were associated with hoping in different degrees (ranging from OR = 1.706 to 3.615).

The present study investigated the association between R/S and the mental health consequences of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Our findings indicated that there was a high use of religious and spiritual beliefs during the pandemic and that this use was associated with better health outcomes, as evidenced by the higher levels of hopefulness and lower levels of fear, worrying and sadness in the more religious and spiritual participants. These results highlight the role of R/S in coping with adverse situations and will be discussed below.
In fact, R/S have been proposed as important tools used to face suffering caused by trauma and stress based on specific strategies also known as spiritual and religious coping (Harrison et al., 2001). Coping can be used by individuals in a positive (e.g. meaning to be found, spiritual connection and benevolent religious reappraisals) or a negative way (e.g. religious struggle, punishment and reappraisal of God’s power) and, for this reason, it could have positive or deleterious consequences (Pargament et al., 1998). Several studies (Ebadi et al., 2009; Schuster et al., 2001; Thune-Boyle et al., 2006) have already shown that coping is frequently used in moments of stress. A previous study has shown that 90% of participants from a representative US sample (Schuster et al., 2001) reported having turned to religion to deal with the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Similar results were also observed in war scenarios (Ebadi et al., 2009) and in chronic diseases (Thune-Boyle et al., 2006).
In the specific case of the COVID-19 pandemic, our results seem to be confirmed, since three out of four participants in this research declare S/R was helping them to cope with the social isolation and more than half have experienced a spiritual growth. Although there are few studies available about the current pandemic, Google searches about prayer doubled for every 80,000 new cases of COVID-19 (Taylor, 2020), besides a great demand for religious and spiritual hotlines (Ribeiro et al., 2020) and religious community conference calls (Galiatsatos et al., 2020) were observed.
Not only the search for R/S seems to have increase, but also these beliefs seem to have a remarkable influence in mental health during the pandemic. Our findings revealed that R/S were associated with better health outcomes such as lower levels of sadness, fear and worrying, while they were also associated with higher levels of hope. Although such results have been extensively discussed in the previous decades (Koenig, 2012), few studies have assessed the actual pandemic moment.
One of the few studies that investigated the influence of R/S on health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic (Weinberger-Litman et al., 2020) included 303 members of North American religious communities and found no association between religious commitment with distress or anxiety. According to the authors, the lack of association is because this population is very religious and composed of members of specific religious traditions which may lead to a low variability of responses and minimized the statistical power. In the present study, this problem was reduced since our sample was more heterogeneous.
Another study (Pirutinsky et al., 2020) has investigated 419 American Orthodox Jews and found that positive religious coping, intrinsic religiosity and trust in God strongly correlated with less stress and more positive impact, while negative religious coping and mistrust in God correlated with the inverse. These results are similar to our findings indicating that faith may promote resilience during crisis.
Among various R/S variables assessed in our study, it is possible to note that spiritual growth and private religious activities were the most associated with positive outcomes during social isolation. These results are interesting because there is a tendency in previous studies to present religious attendance as the most important variable (VanderWeele, 2020a). In the COVID-19 pandemic, the restriction of mobility and social contact prevents routine religious attendance (Nicola et al., 2020) and, for this reason, other R/S strategies seem to offer the same benefits found by organizational religiosity.
According to Koenig (Koenig, 2020), social distance is an opportunity to develop a stronger relationship with God by personal religious activities, reading Holy scriptures and listening to or watching inspiring radio, podcast or TV programs. In the present study, it was possible to verify that at least one third of the participants reported having increased their religious activities during the pandemic. Several other initiatives have also been proposed to reduce the problem of the closure of religious services, such as prayer meetings on the balconies of buildings (Frei-Landau, 2020), religious celebrations in a place where people gather without leaving their vehicles (Modell & Kardia, 2020) and spiritual hotlines (Ribeiro et al., 2020).
Inside the hospitals, where feelings of brevity, finitude, vulnerability and impotence are more evident (Hart, 2020), the spiritual care of the health team, chaplains and local religious groups gains importance (Ferrell et al., 2020; Taylor, 2020). This holistic care can be provided by using compassionate presence, listening and communication skills (Puchalski et al., 2020), openness of the healthcare professional to the patient’s beliefs (Taylor, 2020) and also using telecommunication devices (e.g. telephone-based chaplaincy) for patients in isolation (Sprik et al., 2020). In addition to the genuine attention of the healthcare team, webmeetings with the loved ones and religious leaders seems to reduce loneliness and stress (Ferrell et al., 2020). Finally, R/S may help assisting the bereavement and suffering of the health team and families (Puchalski et al., 2020).
The present study has some limitations that should be considered while interpreting our results. First, this is a cross-sectional study and cause-effect relationships are not allowed. Second, our sample was mostly composed of women with high education levels. This is probably a result of the use of ‘snow ball’ sampling procedure which may have imbalanced the sample. Women are usually more religious than men and this could have impacted the high levels of R/S evidenced in our study. More Brazilian representative studies are needed. Third, Brazil is a highly religious country and more studies are needed in secular societies. Forth, single question measures were used to assess sadness, hope, worrying and fear. More complex instruments may be used in future studies. Finally, as reported previously, coping strategies can have negative and positive influences on mental health. However, our questionnaire was not able to identify the negative aspects of coping, which could have an impact in the outcomes.
Our findings corroborate with the opinion of previous authors that R/S seems to have an important role in reducing suffering, influencing health outcomes and minimizing the consequences of social distance (Hart, 2020; Hart & Koenig, 2020; Koenig, 2020). This data confirms the importance of public health measures to ensure the continuity of religious and spiritual activities during the pandemic and the training of healthcare professionals to address spiritual and religious beliefs of patients and families. Healthcare professionals must be aware of the positive and negative use of individuals’ beliefs in order to provide the most comprehensive care possible.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented unprecedented health challenges across all strata in society throughout the world. The COVID experience has caused us to reflect on quality of life, health and well-being and, just as important, end of life. During this time, spiritual care forms a vital component of holistic health management, especially in terms of coping, coming to terms with illness, suffering and ultimately death. The relationship with the transcendent or sacred has a strong influence on a people’s beliefs, attitudes, emotions and behaviour. Populations, communities, families and individuals have always found solace through their religious or philosophical beliefs during times of personal adversity and widespread anxiety or disaster. Although spiritual care has always been a part of the domain of religious beliefs, a more contemporary perspective is that spiritual care forms part of the human psyche and thus forms part of human care, health and well-being for families, patients and healthcare workers. Spiritual care deals with the provision of compassion and empathy during periods of heightened stress, distress and anxiety within care. This article provides insights into the necessity of providing spiritual care as a means of coping and well-being for families, patients and healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Spirituality is a foundation of all population groups since the beginning of recorded history. It plays an integral component of quality of life, health and well-being both in the general population and those affected by illnesses.1 The relationship with the transcendent or sacred has a strong influence on a people’s beliefs, attitudes, emotions and behaviour. Research has shown that families rely on their spirituality for emotional, mental and physical well-being.2 Spirituality practices have been recognised as a powerful coping mechanism for dealing with life-changing and traumatic events.1 During this global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), does spiritual care contribute as a coping strategy for practitioners and families?
Coronavirus disease is a serious public health problem that has been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic because of its worldwide spread.3 The World Health Organization reports that 4 307 287 people have been tested positive for COVID-19 worldwide in 216 countries.3 Out of the confirmed cases, globally there have been 295 101 deaths related to COVID-19.3 In the South African context, the Department of Health reports that 403 018 tests were conducted, of which 12 739 people were found to be infected by COVID-19 and 5676 people managed to recover from the disease. The recent COVID-19 crisis has resulted in 238 deaths in South Africa.4
The effects of COVID-19 have had a major impact on people’s and front-line health workers’ activities, routines, livelihoods, mental health and well-being.3,5 Healthcare workers risk their lives to save people who have COVID-19 while promoting compassionate care. People who have COVID-19 tend to present with severe distress associated with the disease that affects different aspects of their wholeness, including physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual components.6 This means that the healthcare workers need to create a supportive environment that could promote interdependence through a transformative approach of spiritual care.7 It further means that all patients and their families should be treated with dignity and be given the voice to express their concerns irrespective of gender, religion, culture, race, sexual orientation and disability.6,7
Spiritual care comprises activities that healthcare workers engage in to promote the quality of life and well-being of the clients.6,8 The activities that the healthcare workers and people who have COVID-19 engage in include compassionate presence, listening to patients’ fears, hopes and dreams, obtaining a spiritual history, being attentive to all spheres of patients’ lives and their families.8 However, in terms of COVID-19, some of the activities, such as the involvement of chaplains and spiritual practices, can be limited because of precautionary measures for infection control.9 Spirituality is significant in healthcare because it promotes coping strategies for stress, promotes recovery and resilience and prevents burnout.
Studies have reported that healthcare practitioners who provide spiritual care to their patients contribute significantly to improve their patients’ overall well-being.10,11 Spiritual care is regarded as a life-enhancing factor and a coping resource, which allows patients to deal with adversity in a better way. It may also increase their hopes for the future.12 Research reports significantly increased immune functions in response to spiritual care practices.1
The current restrictions imposed in South Africa amidst the lockdown prevent free movement and access to normal daily services. South Africans are restricted to the confines of their homes, which may increase levels of anxiety in the general population and even more so in those affected by illnesses. This may negatively affect the health and well-being of many South Africans. These restrictions impede the facilitation of spiritual care in clinical settings.13 Spiritual care is based on a bio-psycho-socio-spiritual integrative model that requires a specific set of skills such as active listening, spiritual assessment skills and the ability to refer patients to pastoral care, or other types of intervention services focused on spirituality. For this reason, under the current circumstances, healthcare professionals should be extra-sensitive to the spiritual needs of their patients and their own, as studies have reported that patients’ reliance on spirituality increases during life-changing events.6,8 However, this may be problematic as research indicates that whilst many health professionals agree that spiritual care is important for their patients, many are ill-equipped to deal with this aspect.14 Collaborative effort may be required to draw on the expertise of those practitioners of spiritual care to support the spiritual care needs of families.6
The family as the cornerstone of society is a social determinant of health.15 For example, when families engage in health-risking behaviour, such as smoking, substance abuse, not exercising or not eating correctly, their behaviours could result in in non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. Not only do they place themselves at risk but they also create a negative social atmosphere for their growing children. These patterns could then culminate in health challenges for the next generation. However, families also provide care and support – care of children, the sick and the elderly and support in times of challenges. The most challenging time requiring family support and support to families is during a chronic illness, when one is critically ill and during end of life.16
Research has shown that the spiritual care provider plays an important role when families are faced with challenging health risks and the prospect of palliative care.17 For example, when families are able to get in touch with a spiritual care provider, they offer a supportive role in the decision-making of a family member who is a patient; they have a sense of peace; they have the opportunity for bereavement and grief counselling and just being able to cope in a very difficult time.18,19 The access to spiritual care for the patient and the role of spiritual care for families are clear within the research, but in the case of a pandemic such as COVID-19, where the treatment for the disease becomes limited as more people become sick and the disease is life threatening, there could be challenges to provide this much-needed support. In light of the current global pandemic, examples of the responses of families and communities from countries having faced disasters are discussed.20
The rise in COVID-19 cases in South Africa has necessitated the need for more technologically driven healthcare solutions such as telemedicine. Telemedicine refers to the delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, such as e-mail, telephonic calls, video links and social networks. Globally, many governments and healthcare systems have utilised telemedicine as a primary means of healthcare support during the COVID-19 outbreak. A rise in the number of remotely monitored patients has been reported for most countries.21 During this transition from the physical clinical setting to the virtual one, the importance of spiritual care should not be lost or forgotten because it forms part of the holistic approach to deal with the body–mind–spirit aspect of the population.
